# Psych_Server
Psychology Server Application which talks to Android and web application
This was a part of my Master's Project where we worked with [Prof. Changiz Mohiyeddini] (https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/436790/overview) on his project to treat addiction by retraining the brain's response to certain cues. We worked on creating a mobile app in ReactNative. I was responsible for deploying the server side admin panel to AWS Instance and tweaking the website as per need.
